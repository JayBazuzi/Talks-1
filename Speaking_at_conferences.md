## Invite Me to Speak at Your Conference

I love sharing knowledge and engaging with audiences! Hereâ€™s how you can invite me to speak at your event.

### What You Can Expect

- **Formats:** Keynotes, panels, workshops, and live coding sessions.
- **Engagement:** I only speak at conferences I'd like to attend. Expect me to stay for the entire conference rather than just speaking and leaving.
- **Flexibility:** Open to giving multiple talks at the same event. I can also fill talks in case of a drop-out.

### Travel & Accommodation

- Travel expenses (flights, transportation).
- Hotel stay for the duration of the event (+1 extra day if overseas).

  - Event details:
    - Date
    - Location
    - Expected audience
    - Topics of interest
  - Talk format & duration
  - Honorarium or speaker compensation

I look forward to speaking at your event!
