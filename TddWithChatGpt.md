## Description
"In my talk, 'TDD with ChatGPT,' I do a live coding demo where I write the tests and ChatGPT writes the code. Weâ€™ll see how to break problems into bite-sized pieces, prompt with tests, and iterate based on real feedback. This session aims to show a practical, middle-ground approach to working with AI, avoiding the extremes of 'AI is useless' or 'AI is magical'."

### Learning Objectives:
* Practical TDD
* Effective Prompting
* Iterative Feedback
